FontMapper is a tool that maps characters from a TTF font to a bitmap.
This bitmap can then be loaded in a graphics engine to display fancy text.
Currently it offers 2 save-modes: a generic XML descriptor along with the bitmap,
or an irrlicht(http://irrlicht.sf.net) compatible XML descriptor along with the bitmap.
